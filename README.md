# Dlib-Webcam
<b> Dlib_webcam.py </b>

I used ChatGPT to write me a program in Python that uses the dlib library to access an image from the webcam, plot the face landmarks and print them on the image.

<b> Dlib_image_file.py </b>

I used ChatGPT to alter the previous code to take an image file and plot the face landmark points and save the plotted image. I had issues specifying the path for the images, so I pasted the error messages in ChatGPT and finally got the code to work the way I wanted.
